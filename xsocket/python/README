There are two variants of the python API. The first is a C-like wrapper around
the C functions and the second is an object-based version that mimics python's
socket object.

To use either version, you must ensure two things:
	
	1) Your python program imports "./c_xsocket.py"

	2) "./c_xsocket.py" and "./_c_xsocket.so" are in your python module search
	   path. This can be accomplished by placing links to these files in the
	   same directory as your python file, or by adding them to the environment
	   variable PYTHONPATH (with the same syntax as the standard PATH variable)

	3) "api/lib/libXsocket.so" is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	4) "api/lib/libdagaddr.so" is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

To use the object-oriented version of the API, you must additionally ensure:

	5) Your python program imports "./oo_wrapper/xsocket.py"

	6) "./oo_wrapper/xsocket.py" is in your python module search path (as
		described above)

Running "make" in this directory will prepare both variants of the python API
for use. Running "make" in "api/xsocket" or the xia project tree will do this
for you automatically.
