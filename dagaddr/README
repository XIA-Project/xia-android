To compile, run the following in the "cpp" directory. This will automatically
generate the Python wrapper in the "python" directory as well.

1) Run "cmake ."
2) Run "cmake ." again. For some reason the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX isn't set correctly the first time.
3) Run "make"
4) Run "make install"

To generate documentation, run the following in the "cpp" directory.
Documentation will be built in the "doc" dir in this directory. Currently only
C++ documentation is generated.

1) Run "cmake ." if you haven't already
2) Run "make doc"



To run any code that uses these libraries, be sure you have
<path-to-xia-core>/lib in both your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH environment
variables.
